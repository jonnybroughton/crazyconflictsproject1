                <h2>The Battle of Kursk</h2>
                <p>The Battle of Kursk, which took place from July 5 to August 23, 1943, was one of the largest and most
                    significant confrontations of World War II. It was fought between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union
                    near the city of Kursk in western Russia. The battle marked a turning point on the Eastern Front,
                    with the Soviets decisively defeating the Germans and initiating a series of offensives that would
                    ultimately lead to the downfall of the Third Reich.</p>
                <p>The German offensive, codenamed Operation Citadel, aimed to eliminate a large Soviet salient in the
                    Kursk region, which posed a threat to German-held territory. The Germans amassed a formidable force,
                    including thousands of tanks and aircraft, for the assault. However, Soviet intelligence had
                    intercepted German plans and prepared a massive defensive operation in response.</p>
                <p>The battle began with a German offensive in the north and south of the Kursk salient, but the Soviets
                    had heavily fortified their positions and deployed extensive minefields and anti-tank defenses. The
                    German advance quickly bogged down under withering Soviet defensive fire. In the south, the Soviets
                    launched a preemptive counteroffensive, Operation Kutuzov, which pushed back the Germans and
                    threatened to encircle their forces.</p>
                <p>In the following weeks, the battle raged on with ferocious tank battles and intense fighting on the
                    ground. The Soviets, under the leadership of Generals Georgy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovsky,
                    launched a series of counteroffensives, including Operation Rumyantsev, which further weakened the
                    German positions. By late August, the Germans were forced to retreat, having suffered heavy losses
                    in men and materiel. The Battle of Kursk ended in a decisive Soviet victory and marked a turning
                    point on the Eastern Front, shifting the momentum of the war in favor of the Allies.</p>
