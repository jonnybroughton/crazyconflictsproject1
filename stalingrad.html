                <h2>The Battle of Stalingrad</h2>
                <p>The Battle of Stalingrad, fought from August 23, 1942, to February 2, 1943, during World War II, was
                    a pivotal confrontation between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. It marked a turning point in the
                    war on the Eastern Front. The battle took place in and around the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd)
                    in southern Russia.</p>
                <p>The battle began with a massive German offensive aimed at capturing Stalingrad, a key industrial city
                    and transportation hub on the Volga River. German forces, led by Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus,
                    launched a relentless assault, employing both infantry and aerial bombardment to seize control of
                    the city. However, the Soviets, under the leadership of General Georgy Zhukov, mounted a fierce
                    defense, utilizing urban warfare tactics and deploying reinforcements from across the Soviet Union.
                </p>
                <p>The battle devolved into brutal street-to-street fighting, with both sides suffering heavy
                    casualties. The harsh winter conditions further exacerbated the already dire situation for both
                    German and Soviet troops. Despite initial gains by the Germans, the Soviets managed to encircle the
                    German Sixth Army and parts of the Fourth Panzer Army in a massive pincer movement, trapping them
                    within the city.</p>
                <p>The encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad proved to be a decisive turning point in the war. Cut
                    off from supplies and reinforcements, the German Sixth Army ultimately surrendered on February 2,
                    1943, marking the first major defeat for Nazi Germany in the war. The Battle of Stalingrad resulted
                    in staggering losses on both sides, with estimates of over 2 million casualties. The Soviet victory
                    at Stalingrad not only halted the German advance into the Soviet Union but also set the stage for
                    the eventual Soviet counteroffensive that would push the Germans back to Berlin, ultimately leading
                    to the end of the war in Europe.</p>
