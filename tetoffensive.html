            <div class="battle-text">
                <h2>The Tet Offensive</h2>
                <p>The Tet Offensive, launched by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) during the Vietnam War,
                    began on January 30, 1968, coinciding with the Vietnamese New Year holiday of Tet. It was a
                    coordinated series of surprise attacks on over 100 cities and military installations across South
                    Vietnam, catching both American and South Vietnamese forces off guard. The offensive marked a
                    significant escalation of the conflict and challenged the perception of American military
                    superiority.</p>
                <p>The Tet Offensive demonstrated the tenacity and resilience of the Viet Cong and NVA forces, who had
                    been previously underestimated by American military commanders. Despite suffering heavy casualties,
                    they managed to penetrate deep into urban areas, including the capital, Saigon. The ferocity of the
                    attacks shocked the American public and eroded confidence in the war effort, leading to increased
                    anti-war sentiment and protests back home.</p>
                <p>While the Tet Offensive inflicted considerable losses on the Viet Cong and NVA, it ultimately failed
                    to achieve its primary objective of sparking a general uprising among the South Vietnamese
                    population. American and South Vietnamese forces, supported by intensive aerial bombardment and
                    reinforcements, eventually repelled the attackers and regained control of the cities. However, the
                    psychological impact of the offensive was profound, as it exposed the limitations of American
                    military strategy and fueled doubts about the war's winnability.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of the Tet Offensive, the Johnson administration faced growing criticism over its
                    handling of the war, leading President Lyndon B. Johnson to announce a partial halt in bombing and a
                    willingness to negotiate for peace. The offensive also contributed to a shift in American strategy,
                    with a greater emphasis on Vietnamization - the process of transferring combat responsibilities to
                    South Vietnamese forces - and eventually paved the way for the withdrawal of American troops from
                    Vietnam.</p>
