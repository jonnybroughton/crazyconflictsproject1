                <h2>The Battle of Waterloo (1815)</h2>
                <p>The Battle of Waterloo, fought on June 18, 1815, was a pivotal conflict during the Napoleonic Wars.
                    It marked the final showdown between Napoleon Bonaparte and the coalition forces led by the Duke of
                    Wellington and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. Napoleon, seeking to regain power after his exile,
                    faced off against the British, Dutch, Belgian, and Prussian armies near the town of Waterloo in
                    present-day Belgium.</p>
                <p>The battle began with a French assault on the British-held farmhouse of Hougoumont and the village of
                    La Haye Sainte. Despite fierce resistance, the French managed to capture Hougoumont but failed to
                    take La Haye Sainte, which served as a key defensive position for the British. Meanwhile, the
                    Prussian army under Blücher engaged the French right flank, diverting Napoleon's attention and
                    forcing him to split his forces.</p>
                <p>As the day progressed, both sides suffered heavy casualties. The arrival of the Prussian
                    reinforcements on the battlefield tipped the scales in favor of the coalition forces. With his army
                    outnumbered and exhausted, Napoleon launched a desperate final assault, known as the "Attack of the
                    Old Guard," but it was repelled by the British and their allies. Eventually, Napoleon's forces were
                    routed, leading to his final abdication and subsequent exile to the island of Saint Helena.</p>
                <p>The Battle of Waterloo is remembered as one of the most significant conflicts in European history,
                    effectively ending Napoleon's rule and reshaping the balance of power on the continent. It
                    symbolizes the defeat of authoritarian rule and the triumph of coalition warfare, marking the
                    beginning of a new era of peace and stability in Europe.</p>
