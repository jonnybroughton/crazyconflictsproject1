# Crazy Conflicts
Crazy Conflicts is an upcoming historical documentation website, which has a main focus of individual battles that take place in larger wars. The goal of the website is to present the user with fast facts and figures in a creative and accessible way to allow them to get all the information they need, and none that they don't.
