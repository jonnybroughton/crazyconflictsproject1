# Crazy Conflicts
Crazy Conflicts is an upcoming historical documentation website, which has a main focus of individual battles that take place in larger wars. The goal of the website is to present the user with fast facts and figures in a creative and accessible way to allow them to get all the information they need, and none that they don't.

## Features
### Nav bar

- The navbar helps users to jump to the different time periods the site provides, as well as information regarding the site with the About Us link. 

- The logo of the site can also be clicked to return to the home page of the website

### Home page main content

- The main section of the home page catches the eye with a large impressive image and addresses the user with an inspiring tagline over it.

- The user is then greeted with a brief description to help them understand the purpose of the website and what it can teach them. At the end of the page they are given an instruction to pick a time period to go to, giving them a sense of direction and drawing their attention to the nav bar, where the navigation takes place.

### Footer

- The focal point of the footer is the social media icons it showcases. This uses simplicity to its advantage by letting the user know there are multiple ways to stay connected without taking up unnecessary space and distracting from the main content.

### Battle list page

- The battle list pages display the latest battles that have been covered by the website. This gives the user a sense of being involved in a service that is active and being updated frequently.

- The list items are big and visible, and they shrink to fit smaller viewports bringing the image and the text closer together. 

### Battle page

- The battle pages have been split into two sides, the left for the text information and the right for the visual information, which creates a smooth experience for the user as the page presents well visually by keeping the content separate.

- The page has a concise description of the events of the battle, giving them a crash course in each battle, from why it started, what happened within it, and what the outcome of the battle ultimately ended up being. Complimenting this text are the visuals, first showing a map to help the user visualise where the battle took place on the planet, and a photo or painting from or about the battle, which lets the user really get an understanding of what the battle was really like. Finally, we have a table. This is designed to give the user the most important statistics they need to know, at a glance. 

### About Us

- The About Us page is seperated into 4 sections, presented as a grid when viewed on a laptop or computer or a column on tablets and smaller devices. It presents the user with all the necessary information in a clear and distinguished way, without overwhelming them.

- The about us page is very interactive, with an iframe of the business location on google maps that can also be zoomed in and out along with being opened in a new tab. Users also have chance to rate the site and leave a message should they wish to give more descriptive feedback. It also contains a short message providing more details about the company behind the website.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- No errors for home page

- While there are errors in the About Us page, they are related to labels having for attributes, but this in no way affects the user experience. Other errors pertain to the iframe, but again none of this affects the look of the page nor the user experience, and are carried over by copying the html from google's 'embed a map' feature.
